# Instructions  

Rotation 6/Unit 1 Final

# Overview

As indicated by the title, this project will be very similar to the previous project. You will use an array, loops, and objects to keep track of and draw multiple objects with distinct properties. 

Further, you will independently explore different parts of the P5 library to create your objects and interact with your project. There are many things that we haven't covered, such as:

* anything under 'Curves' or 'Vertex' in the **Shapes** section.  
* anything in the **Events** section (other than `key`, `keyCode`, and `keyPressed()`).
* anything under 'Conversion' or 'String Functions' in the **Data** section.
* anything under 'Time and Date' in the **IO** section.
* the `lerp()` or `lerpColor()` functions.
* anything in the **Math** section
* anything in the **Typography** section 
* the `translate()` and `rotate()` functions (along with `push()` and `pop()`)

## Grading Details

This is the Final Project for the Unit. It is weighted the same as any rotation project. However, since it represents a summary of everything we've learned this unit, it can also replace grades in the grade book. Let's say your R2-R5 project grades are 86, 93, 75, 89. If you got a 91 on this project, the gradebook for R2-R5 would now look like: 91, 93, 91, 91, along with another 91 for R6. The only exception to this is if you haven't completed a particular project (except by prior arrangement).

# Details

## Play!

Take some time to experiment with some of the P5 things listed above, or cruise through [reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) and find your own. 

### A quick note on 3D

As I may have mentioned in class, P5 supports drawing in 3D. It is cool and nifty and all of that, but it is, in several different ways, fundamentally different than P5's 2D drawing capabilities. It is a long, dark, and winding road that I recommend you travel via an IDP and not on this project. You've been warned.

## Plan

Draw a picture of what you want to happen. Your drawing should include two distinct things. 

1. A detailed description of _one_ of the things you will be keeping track of and drawing. What properties does it have? 
2. A larger picture of what will be happening in the sketch. Show how the many things will be arranged (at least, theoretically) and how they will change over time. 

## Program

Your work will happen throught the various parts of the sketch. You will declare variables, including one or more arrays (ideally, above `setup`), you will initialize those variables in `setup`, and you will need to draw your things inside `draw`. Feel free to declare any other functions you like. 

### The Development Cycle

1. Plan.
2. Plan some more. 
3. Make sure your plan includes developing things in a step-by-step fashion.
4. Get one thing working (for instance, can you get one boring "thing" that doesn't change to show up somewhere?)
5. Make sure it works (try different values for location or other properties to make sure it is working).
6. Get another thing working (can you have multiple things showing up? Can you get them to change their properties? Can you get them to move?).
7. Make sure it is working AND that you haven't broken previous things.
8. Repeat steps 6 & 7 until you're done with your plan. 
9. Revise your plan. 
10. Start with step 3, and repeat until awesome. 

# Requirements 

** All ** - You must submit a drawing (or multiple drawings) of what you want to achieve by creating a `.draw` file here, or by some other means. Your drawing(s) must include details about one of your "things," including how it will change over time throughout your sketch, and also how all things might be arranged. You must use at least one array to contain your things, as well as a loop to make changes to and draw your things. There must be many things. It is right there in the title. Your sketch also needs to include a user guide that is displayed when the sketch starts and can be hidden by the user with a key press (example given in the sketch)

**CS1** - You must make use of at least one new bit of P5 functionality (check the list above). Further, your project must, in some non-trivial way, respond to a keyboard press.

**Honors** - Your sketch must make use of at least three new bits of P5 functionality, bundle the properties of a thing into an object, store those objects in an array, and use the for-each loop to update and draw the objects. Finally, your sketch must respond to different key presses or mouse events.
